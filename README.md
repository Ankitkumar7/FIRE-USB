FIRE USB
USB DATA TRANSMISSION USING FIBRE OPTICS
A technology that uses glass (or plastic) threads (fibers) to transmit data. A fiber optics cable consists of a bundle of glass threads, each of which is capable of transmitting messages modulated onto light waves

ABOUT FIRE USB:
Fire USB provides very high speed data transmission up to 1gb per second
Wire USB Cable transmit data at very low speed but by using fiber optics data can be transmit in the form of light.
USB Optical Cables by Corning connects computers and device at incredible speed and over longer distance. Theyâ€™re thin, light and remarkably tough.


How it works:

Fibre optics transmit data to VCSEL(Tx) and photodiode(Rx)  , by the use of optical conversion the light will convert int,
electrical Transmisson, after conversion data will transmit to USB 3.0 / 2.0 connector.
